# Text Detection Program

## Overview

This program utilizes TensorFlow to perform text detection in images. It is based on the EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text) text detection model and includes functionality for converting the model to TensorFlow Lite format with optional quantization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- imutils
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (for running the provided code)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dilhelh/opencv-text-detection.git
   ```

2. Download the EAST text detection model:

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/sayakpaul/Adventures-in-TensorFlow-Lite/releases/download/v0.11.0/coco_text_100.tar.gz
   tar xf coco_text_100.tar.gz
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the text detection script on a sample image:

   ```bash
   python /path/to/text_detection.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --east /path/to/frozen_east_text_detection.pb
   ```

2. Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format:

   ```bash
   python /path/to/tf_lite_conversion.py
   ```

   - You can specify the quantization type by setting the `quantization` variable in the script.

3. Inference with TensorFlow Lite model:

   ```python
   python /path/to/inference_script.py
   ```

   - Specify the path to the TensorFlow Lite model and the input image in the script.

## Model Quantization

- The script supports both float16 and int8 quantization. You can choose the desired quantization by setting the `quantization` variable in the conversion script.

## Input Image Preprocessing

- The provided script demonstrates how to preprocess input images for text detection.

## Inference and Post-processing

- The inference script performs text detection using the TensorFlow Lite model and post-processes the results to draw bounding boxes around detected text regions.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- imutils
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (for running the provided code)

## Acknowledgments

- The text detection model is based on the EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text) model.
